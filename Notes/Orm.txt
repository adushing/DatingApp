What is ORM ?
	- An Object Relational Mapper
	- Translates our code into SQL commands that updates our tables in the database.
	
Need of Entity framework
	- Prior to .net 3.5(original .net framework), we often use to write ADO .net code to save or retrieve application
	  data from an underlying database.
	- 1. Open connection to db 
	  2. Create a dataset to fetch
	  3. Convert data from dataset to .net objects.
	This was a cumbersome and errorprone process, coz we would be writing the db access codes as sql codes which would be in
	the form of strings and it was easy to make mistakes.
Hence entity framework is required.
